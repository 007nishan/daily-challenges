Create a function called `zodiac_sign(day, month)` that returns the corresponding zodiac sign for a given birth date. 

For example, if the input is `day=21, month=3` (March 21), the output should be 'Aries'. 

Also ensure correct date boundaries are handled (e.g., February 30th should be invalid).
